# Vanilla Javascript Waston App
The simplest Watson AI app ever! You use Watson with a url. 

    var url = 'https://gateway-a.watsonplatform.net/calls/text/TextGetEmotion?outputMode=json&apikey=YOURAPIKEY&text=Hello!';
    
The app uses Handlebars and Jquery to display a form, then do something with Watson with whatever you type. The entire app uses Vanilla Javascript and patterns you know like Singleton, Configuration Objects, Namespaces and more. Also, this app uses AJAX with the Watson API.
